          This web app is a BtoC platform where the professional car dealers can
          publish, edit and remove their sale offers. The professional account
          allows also to view all your current offers at once. The offer page
          displays the information about the vehicle characteristics as well as
          the date of publication, the name of the car dealer, his phone number
          and the address. The location is visually presented on Google Maps.
          The data is fetched by Google API.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The client user can filter the current offers by vehicle
          characteristics, price and location. The fetched data can be sorted by
          price in ascending and descending order. The logged in user can add
          offers to the list of favourites and remove them. It is also possible
          to view the full list of your current favourites.{" "}
